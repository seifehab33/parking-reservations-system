While reviewing the project setup, I noticed a couple of important points in the backend configuration (server.js):

CORS setup – It is not configured correctly, which may block requests from the frontend. Proper CORS middleware configuration is needed to allow requests from the client.

Missing endpoints – Not all required APIs are implemented in server.js. For example, endpoints for retrieving rush hours and vacation hours should exist but are not currently present.

I wanted to highlight these gaps since they are essential for the frontend to communicate properly with the server.
